## About Me

Hi, my name is Jafet Mendez. I am passionate about technology and always eager to learn new things.

I currently work in technical support, but I am working toward becoming a Cloud Engineer â€” a field that truly excites me for its innovation and future potential.

I am happily married and a proud father of one daughter. My wife and I are currently expecting our second baby, and we couldnâ€™t be more excited.

Outside of tech, I am deeply passionate about football (soccer), and I enjoy watching and analyzing the game.

I am also one of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses, and my faith is a very important part of my life.
